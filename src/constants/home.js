  title: "Public Safety, Japan Branch",
  desc: `We are a government-run organization in Japan responsible for protecting civilians from devils. They operate through local branches in each prefecture, with divisions specializing in high-risk missions, such as Tokyo’s infamous Special Division 4. Members can be humans, fiends, or hybrids, often making contracts with devils to gain combat abilities. While they focus on exterminating dangerous devils, the government also captures certain devils for strategic use. The job is notoriously dangerous, with high mortality rates even among skilled hunters. Key figures in Division 4 include Makima, Aki Hayakawa, Denji, Power, and other unique operatives.`,
